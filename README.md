# Flight Log

## Context:
Flight Log is an innovative React Native app, meticulously crafted by a skilled and collaborative team of 4 front-end developers and 3 back-end developers. Together, we combined our expertise and creativity to cater to the needs of pilots seeking efficient flight management right from their mobile devices. With its mobile-friendly interface, this software development project empowers users to effortlessly log their flights, maintain essential flight details, and enjoy the convenience of on-the-go flight tracking. Pilots can easily access comprehensive flight cards and obtain in-depth information with just a click, making Flight Log the ultimate companion for seamless and streamlined flight management.

## Technologies:
- **React Native**: We leveraged React Native, a popular JavaScript framework, to create a seamless and native-like mobile app experience across both Android and iOS platforms.

- **Cypress**: For comprehensive and reliable end-to-end testing, we utilized Cypress, a modern testing framework that ensures the quality and stability of our application.

- **APIs**: Integrating external APIs allowed us to access and utilize valuable data and functionalities, enriching our app with real-time information and services.

- **Git**: We employed Git as our version control system, facilitating collaboration and enabling efficient tracking of code changes and improvements.

- **CircleCI**: CircleCI served as our robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform, automating the process of building, testing, and deploying our code. It played a crucial role in maintaining a reliable and efficient development workflow.

- **Figma**: Figma played a crucial role in our design process, serving as a collaborative platform for creating and visualizing the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of our app.

## Installation Instructions:

### Download Xcode:

If you are using a Mac, go to the App Store and download Xcode, which is required for iOS development.
For Windows users, this step is not necessary if you intend to use Android emulation only.

### Install Node.js:

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website.

### Install Expo CLI:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Expo CLI globally:

```npm install -g expo-cli```

### Clone the Project Repository:

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.
Navigate to the Project Directory:

In the terminal or command prompt, change your working directory to the project folder.

### Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```npm install```

### Start the Development Server:

To launch the development server, run the following command:

```npx expo start```

### View the App:

Once the development server starts, you will see a QR code in the terminal. Use the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device to scan the QR code and view the app on your phone.

Alternatively, you can select one of the options presented in the terminal (such as "w" for web, "i" for iOS simulator, or "a" for Android emulator) to view the app in your preferred environment.
